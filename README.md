# SweetieBirthdayDemo
A demo program written in JavaScript as a digital birthday card for my wife.

This demonstration program was written in aproximately 3 hours between the time I finished breakfast and when my wife
returned from work. Needless to say, there are likely several hacky pieces of code in there I would not normally allow
and the lack of comments is another severe problem. However, the concept was designed to be simple enough to make
bug fixing quick and as painless as possible.
